# Rogue Survivor Alpha 9
Rogue Survivor game original source code from 2012

<h3>** OUTDATED **</h3>
<p>
If you want the <i><b>latest available source code</b></i> download the latest zipped source from the game blog here : <br>
  http://roguesurvivor.blogspot.com/p/download.html <br>
The zip includes the resources and the Visual Studio project, everything you need to start your project from it. The license still applies.
</p>

<h3>WHAT IS THIS</h3>
<p>
This is the game source source from 2012. I did not touch it since then.<br>
There is no data files or resources, you have to download the game for that (see next section).<br>
There is no project files or libraries. They are probably obsolete by now anyway and I don't even know if the code will compile in recent C# compilers/IDEs.<br>
I can't provide support for compiling or answer code/gameplay questions, it's been a long time and I've moved on. I hope you'll understand!
</p>

<h3>GET THE GAME</h3>
<p>
The original blog where you can get the game is still alive, so go there:
http://roguesurvivor.blogspot.com/<br>
You'll need this for the resources (data files, images etc...)
</p>

<h3>WHAT YOU CAN DO WITH IT</h3>
<p>
Anything but nothing commercial <i>please</i>. See the license file.
</p>

<h3>THANK YOU & CLOSING WORDS</h3>
<p>
That's a thank you from ME to YOU guys!<br>
Some of you guys have some serious dedication for this game! It is both scary and awesome... scarysome!?<br>
Sorry for failing you by not working more on the game or being more responsive!<br>
From time to time I secretly tried to revive the game or start a new incarnation. I didn't tell you guys because all I had to show was a couple of prototypes that didn't go very far and I didn't want to repeat the RS2 fiasco...<br>
Anyway, I don't plan on updating the game, so go ahead and have fun!!
